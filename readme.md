# GCD and LCM Project

* smallOne and bigOne variables are used to reduce the number of loops
in while loops. 
* In the while loop where gcd value is found, the loop is started smallOne. 
Thus, the number of transaction in the loop is reduced.
* In the while loop where lcd value is found, the loop started from
bigOne. The lcd value is already the least common multiple, so it is more
logical to start with bigOne.
